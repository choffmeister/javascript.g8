## Development

Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) installed globally. Then install the dependencies and start up a development web server with a demo view and fancy stuff like file watching and live reloading.

~~~ bash
\$ npm install
\$ bower install
\$ gulp
~~~
